What part of the code was most confusing and why?

I found that asynchronous programming is a bit challenging for me. However, one of my regulars at my job, who has been coding for the last 20 years, explained it to me in this way:
"Think of it like when you're making the coffee, you would usually steam milk while the shot is being poured, all while trying not to let the milk build up foam."

How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?

The animation helps visualize the behavior through the hourglass emojis, and as it runs, the emojis change until the run is complete. This is what helps see the code run while it does or gets something else.

What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?

I added buttons so that the user could start or pause. This allows control over the program, removing the ability to let it run forever.
